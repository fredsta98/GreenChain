# Problem Identified
The total CO2 emissions generated from their operations, specifically factories. This information can assist management in developing strategies to control CO2 emissions and obtain carbon credits from the government. Carbon credits are mechanisms aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Marketplace to trade carbon tokens. No transparent transaction to public. lack of co2 carbon credit utilization and awareness.

# Solution Developed
The Carbon Emssion of the various industry has been stored in the XDC Blockchain EVM with high transparancy and high stability. Automated credit system helps to reduce the carbon emissiom. For the carbon credit management XRC-20 Token (GCT) is developed for the carbon trading. Key Features,
- Verifed KYC Verification Process (IPFS)
- Carbon Decentralized Marketplace
- Automated Carbon Credit System
- AI Predective Analysis of future Co2 Emsision Data
- Realtime monitoring and tracking of Co2
- Individual can contribute and get rewards
